# Hands-on Examples
The examples included in this folder offer a unique way to visualize the data in the IMDB movie dataset of 5,000 movies, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset).
The examples are pulled from Gary Ng's Kaggle notebook, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/xingobar/movie-data-visualization).

The purpose of these examples is to provide a basic understanding about the powers of Data Science, and in particular, Python's abilities in the space of data visualization.

1. To start each example, open up an Anaconda terminal and type `jupyter notebook` to open Jupyter.  Then, click **New** and select **Python 3** from the dropdown menu.

2. Open the example your instructor indicates.

3. Highlight the code up to the comment that reads `# STOP AND PRESS SHIFT + ENTER`.  Do as the comment says to run the code in Jupyter.  You should see some output displayed in the space below the in-line editor.

Repeat Step 3 until you reach the end of the file and run the code in Jupyter.
