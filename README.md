# IT CON - DATA SCIENCE

Data Science is one of the fastest-evolving and most important fields in the technology industry.  It spans almost every industry--from agriculture to the media to athletics.  When it comes to making informed decisions about anything, it can be helpful to leverage historical data.  Data Science is all about using the past to predict the future.

## Python

Python is a programming language used frequently in Data Science because of its numerous powerful libraries.  Programmers write libraries to extend the functionality of the language and make it easier for other programmers to perform complicated tasks.  Because of these libraries and other features built into Python, it is often the Data Scientist's first choice for analyzing large datasets.  [See why](https://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/blog/whypython.html).

### Basic Python Tutorial

Before we can perform any complex analyses, we need to learn the basics.  This section will introduce you to the language.  We will go over basic syntax, features, and libraries.

### Python Data Analysis

Now, we will turn to several complete examples of how you can write simple Python code that analyzes a giant dataset.  Look at the src folder of this repository.  These programs work on a dataset of 5,000 movies pulled from IMDB.  They draw connections among data points and help users visualize those connections.  We can use graphs, charts, and other visualization techniques to help people understand our data.
